## üìã Events

### On Change

Triggered when any form field value changes.

**Context:**

- `__value`: Complete form data object
- `__valid`: Overall form validity status
- `__dirty`: Whether form has unsaved changes
- `__currentStep`: Current step in multi-step forms
- `__currentStepValid`: Current step validation status

## üéØ Actions

- **ValidateForm**: Validate all form fields
- **ClearForm**: Reset form to initial state
- **UpdateFieldValue**: Update specific field value
  - **Bulk Update Hack**: To update multiple fields at once, use field name `"_value"` with an object containing field-value pairs. The component will match keys (case-insensitively) to existing field names and update them accordingly. If the value is a JSON string, it will be parsed first. This provides a way to set the entire form state in a single action.
- **ScrollTo**: Scroll to form section or field
- **ChangeFormStep**: Navigate to specific form step
- **RefreshDatasource**: Refresh connected data sources

## üé® Styling

Supports comprehensive styling with:

- **Layout Control**: Column-based responsive layout
- **Visual States**: Validation and interaction states
- **Theme Integration**: Consistent with Budibase design
- **Custom CSS**: Advanced visual customization

## üîç Best Practices

- Use multi-step forms for complex workflows
- Configure appropriate permissions for security
- Implement validation for data integrity
- Consider mobile users for form layout
- Test sub-form functionality thoroughly
- Use appropriate column counts for readability
